# Predicting-Credit-Risk-for-German-Customers-using-Tree-Based-Methods-with-Imbalanced-Classes 

Tree-based methods
We study the German credit data set from the UC Irvine machine learning repository. A set of 20 covariates
(attributes) are available (7 numerical, 13 categorical) for 300 customers with bad credit risk and 700 customers
with good credit risk (0 = Good, 1 = Bad).
We aim to classify a customer as good or bad with respect to credit risk. It is worse to class a customer as
good when they are bad, than it is to class a customer as bad when they are good. 

We want to try all 4 tree methods: single classification tree, bagging, random forest, boosting.
then, we Compare between the above 4 methods using the results and plots, such as the test misclassification error rates, AUC, etc,in order to select the best method.
